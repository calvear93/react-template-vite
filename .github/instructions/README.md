# Instructions

These are the **deep-reference documents** for AI assistants and developers. The canonical,
tool-agnostic entry point is [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) at the repository root — start
there. These files hold the long-form detail it links to, each with a single, non-overlapping
scope:

| File                                                                       | Scope                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`architecture-guide.instructions.md`](architecture-guide.instructions.md) | Folder topology, configuration/IoC wiring, routing, feature flags, import conventions |
| [`coding-standards.instructions.md`](coding-standards.instructions.md)     | Formatting, naming, file suffixes, TypeScript rules, comments, anti-patterns          |
| [`patterns.instructions.md`](patterns.instructions.md)                     | Copy-paste recipes: components, hooks, services, schemas, forms, errors, tests        |

Each file carries `applyTo` frontmatter so GitHub Copilot can apply it as a path-scoped
instruction; other tools read them as plain documentation linked from `AGENTS.md`.
